        <h2>Description</h2>
        Fettuccine Alfredo is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich
        and creamy sauce made from butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese. The
        sauce beautifully coats wide fettuccine noodles, creating a luscious,
        silky texture. The dish is often seasoned simply with salt, pepper, and
        sometimes garlic for extra flavor. It's quick to prepare and can be
        served as a comforting main course or paired with grilled chicken,
        shrimp, or vegetables. Traditionally garnished with fresh parsley,
        Fettuccine Alfredo is beloved for its simplicity and indulgence.

            <li>

                water and cook the fettuccine pasta according to package

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the sauce</strong>: In a large skillet over

                <strong>Add the cheese</strong>: Stir in the grated Parmesan
                cheese and continue to stir until the cheese is fully melted and

            <li>
                <strong>Garnish and serve</strong>: Garnish with fresh parsley,
