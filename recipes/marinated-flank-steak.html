        <h2>Description</h2>
        Marinated flank steak is a flavorful and tender dish made by soaking a
        flank steak in a rich marinade to infuse it with flavor before grilling
        or searing. Flank steak, a lean cut of beef, benefits from marinating as
        it helps to tenderize the meat and enhance its taste. The marinade
        typically includes a mix of acidic ingredients like lime juice or
        vinegar, combined with oil, soy sauce, and seasonings like garlic,
        honey, and herbs. After marinating, the steak is cooked quickly at high
        heat and sliced thinly against the grain, making it perfect for dishes
        like fajitas, salads, or sandwiches.

            <li>Honey (1 tablespoon)</li>
            <li>Garlic (3 cloves, minced)</li>
            <li>Fresh lime juice (2 tablespoons)</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper (1 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Red pepper flakes (optional, 1/2 teaspoon for heat)</li>
            <li>
                Fresh herbs (optional, such as rosemary or thyme, 1 tablespoon
                chopped)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Prepare the marinade</strong>: In a bowl or resealable
                bag, combine olive oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar,
                Worcestershire sauce, honey, minced garlic, lime juice, black
                pepper, salt, and optional red pepper flakes or herbs. Whisk
                everything together until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Marinate the steak</strong>: Place the flank steak into
                the marinade, ensuring it's fully coated. Seal the bag or cover
                the dish and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably
                overnight for maximum flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat the grill or pan</strong>: When ready to cook,
                heat a grill to medium-high or preheat a cast-iron skillet over
                medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the steak</strong>: Remove the steak from the
                marinade, allowing excess liquid to drip off. Grill or sear the
                steak for 4-6 minutes per side, depending on your desired level
                of doneness (medium-rare is recommended).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Rest the steak</strong>: Once cooked, remove the flank
                steak from the grill or pan and let it rest for 5-10 minutes to
                allow the juices to redistribute.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Slice and serve</strong>: Slice the steak thinly against
                the grain for tender pieces. Serve with your favorite sides like
                roasted vegetables, potatoes, or a salad.
            </li>
