        <h2>Description</h2>
        Lasagna is made by layering cooked lasagna noodles with alternating
        layers of a rich meat or vegetable sauce, cheese (typically ricotta,
        mozzarella, and Parmesan), and a creamy béchamel or tomato-based sauce.
        The meat sauce often consists of ground beef or Italian sausage cooked
        with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, while the cheese mixture is sometimes
        mixed with eggs and herbs like parsley. Once the layers are built, the
        lasagna is baked in the oven until bubbly and golden on top, allowing
        the flavors to meld and the cheese to melt perfectly. It is then rested
        briefly before serving.

                    <li>
                        In a large pan, heat olive oil and sauté the diced onion

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 2 beaten eggs,
                        chopped parsley, and 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan. Season
                        with a pinch of salt and pepper.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Assemble the lasagna:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spread a thin layer of meat sauce at the bottom of a
                        9x13 inch baking dish.
                    </li>
                    <li>Lay 3-4 cooked lasagna noodles on top.</li>
                    <li>
                        Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the
                        noodles.
                    </li>
                    <li>Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
                    <li>Top with 1/3 of the meat sauce.</li>
                    <li>
                        Repeat these layers (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella,
                        sauce) two more times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For the final layer, top with noodles, remaining sauce,
                        and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan
                        cheese.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the lasagna is bubbly and the
                cheese is melted and golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving to allow the layers
                to set.
            </li>
        </ol>
